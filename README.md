# Background
Today, we can see that technological advances are very helpful in facilitating human life. If in the past we did everything manually and conventionally, but with the development of technology we can do it very quickly and of course the convenience will definitely be obtained.
If we look at the current conditions, there are lots of hotel booking applications that have sprung up. That means there is a huge demand in the hospitality sector. Manually booking a hotel by visiting the hotel and then ordering it is not wrong, but what if we go to an area but we don't know where to rent the lodging, it must be troublesome for us. Then what if when we book it turns out that the hotel is fully occupied, of course we are confused about where to stay.

# Purposes
In this project, we created a hotel reservation program that makes it easier for consumers to book hotels more easily. This program can also assist consumers in choosing room types, room floors, and additional facilities provided by Sayur Asem Hotel. In addition, this program also assists consumers in calculating the costs they have to spend to book the hotel.
In addition to providing convenience to consumers, of course this hotel reservation program also provides convenience for hotel owners. Hotel owners do not need to calculate booking fees manually, but can be assisted by this program in calculating costs that must be incurred by consumers which can be seen from the receipts issued after the visitor makes a hotel reservation.
